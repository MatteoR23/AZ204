What is Azure App Service:

	- HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST API, mobile back ends.
	- I can develop with my fav programming language (.NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP or Python)
	- Run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux based env

Features;
	- Auto scale support: Scale up or Scale out (increase mem/cpu or servers) / Scale down or scale in (decrease mem/cpu or servers).
	- Continuous integration/ deployment: supports Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, FTP or local GIT.
	- Different deployment slots (different than prod environment).


Linux fatures:
App Service cah host web apps natively on Linux.


Limits:
	- Shared pricing tier not supported
	- You can't mix Windows apps and Linux apps on the same App Service paln
	- You can't mix Windows and Linux apps on the same resource group if resource group created before 21/01/2021

App Service Plan:
It's a definition of set of compute resurces for a webapp to run
On each of them you define:
	- Region
	- Number of VM
	- Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)
	- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated)
	
Pricing tier:

	- Shared & Free: Uses same resource pool of other customers. Scale is not supported.
	- Dedicated compute: all resource on same APP Service Plan run on a dedicated VM. More is the tier, more it can scale out
	- Isolated: dedicated VM on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. (max scale out capabilities).
	- Consumption: only on function apps: dynamic scale depending on workload
	
When to isolate:
	- resource intensive
	- scale indipendently than other apps
	- app needs resources on a different geographical region
